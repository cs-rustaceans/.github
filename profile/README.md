# Bucketlist
Project for Software Engineering class made by three hardcore friends: [@georgerapeanu](https://github.com/georgerapeanu), [@AlexPop28](https://github.com/AlexPop28) and [@Laurcons](https://github.com/Laurcons).

What it does is it keeps track of vacation destinations requested by employees in an enterprise setting, in form of a Web application with a React frontend and Rust backend.

Made in 2023.

## Wanna try?
The application is currently being hosted at [dev.csse.laurcons.ro](https://dev.csse.laurcons.ro).

For testing and playing around, you can use the following credentials:
*  `employee@employee` / pass `employee`
*  `admin@admin` / pass `admin`
